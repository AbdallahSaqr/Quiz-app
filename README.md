# Quiz-app
This is a simple Quiz Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app presents multiple-choice questions, tracks the user's score, and displays the final result on a separate page. The application prevents users from proceeding until all questions are answered and ensures correct answers are counted.
